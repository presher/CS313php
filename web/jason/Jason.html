			<h1>WELCOME</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jason Presher. I currently reside in Texas with my family. I am a truck driver who going to school to larn to become a web developer.
            I have 3 semesters left before graduation. I attend an online school through BYU Idaho. In order to participate in this program I had to enter a program called
            pathway. It was a three semester course through the church that did not earn any credits or tax exemptions. When I graduate I hope to be able to enter a good 
            employer to learn how to program in the real world and them eventually do some free lancing on the side and then eventually full time. </p>
